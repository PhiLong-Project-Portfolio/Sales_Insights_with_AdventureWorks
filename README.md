### About my project
In this project, I used SQL for data extraction, analytics and manipulation, and Power BI for visualization, I aimed to uncover key business insights and trends that can drive strategic decision-making.

The analysis focuse on three core aspects:

- **Sales Overview:** Detailed examination of sales performance across various dimensions such as time, geography, and sales channels, providing a clear picture of revenue trends and growth opportunities.

### Conclusion
Through a analysis of the AdventureWorksDW, I have gained valuable insights into sales overview, customer segmentation, and product performance. By leveraging SQL queries, I extracted meaningful information that can guide business decisions and strategies. Additionally, the Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive picture of sales, customers, and products of the company. The interactive components and insightful visualizations allow users to explore, understand, and make informed decisions effectively.

However, the project is based on a sample data warehouse, which may not fully capture the complexities of a real-world business environment. Additionally, the dataset spans from January 2011 to February 2014, and does not include more recent data, potentially limiting the applicability of the insights.
